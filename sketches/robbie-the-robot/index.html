    <h1>Robbie the Robot - Genetic Algorithm Evolution</h1>
    <p class="sketch-description">
      Watch as a population of robots evolves using genetic algorithms to efficiently collect cans in a grid world. Each
      robot is controlled by a simple genome - the best performers pass their "genes" to the next generation, while poor
      performers are eliminated. Over hundreds of generations, you'll see increasingly intelligent behavior emerge.
    </p>
    <div class="controls-info">
      <strong>What you're seeing:</strong> The visualization shows the best robot from the current generation navigating
      a 10×10 grid world containing 50 randomly placed cans. The genetic algorithm runs in a background worker thread
      with a population of 20,000 robots per generation.

      <h3>Technical Details</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Population Size:</strong> 20,000 robots per generation</li>
        <li><strong>Genome:</strong> Each robot has a simple genome that matches a possible state (the presence or
          absence of a can or wall at each of the four cardinal directions, plus the present square) with an action
          (move in a cardinal direction, move randomly (but safely), or attempt to take the can at the present square)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fitness Function:</strong> Robots are scored based on cans collected during their lifetime</li>
        <li><strong>Selection:</strong> Top performers are selected for reproduction with mutation</li>
        <li><strong>Environment:</strong> 10×10 grid world with 50 randomly distributed cans</li>
        <li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Each robot gets 200 moves (2 × grid area) to collect as many cans as possible
        </li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Uses Web Workers for non-blocking genetic algorithm computation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Evolution Progress</h3>
      <p>Monitor the browser console to see generation-by-generation progress including best and worst fitness scores.
        You should observe steady improvement over time as successful strategies emerge and spread through the
        population.</p>
